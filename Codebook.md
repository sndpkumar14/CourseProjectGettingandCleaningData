## Codebook for Getting and Cleaning Data Course project

This codebook describes meta data on input datasets, output datasets and all the steps needed for processing
It has dictionary of all the variables used in tidy data

The processing uses 2 sets of data:
- test data 
- train data 

It combines them with *activity* and *subject* data.

There are 2 outputs - one long dataset and one **tidy** dataset

Long Dataset contains following columns
- subject
- activity
- values of mean and std variables

Tidy dataset contains *average* values per set of subject and activity
